## Objectives:
* Update your existing functionality by using Method factory
* Implement service for the local storage as Singleton

## Arch notes:
Example about prefix: we try to save ‘token’ with value ‘1234’ to the storage and we set prefix ‘JS-Band-’, we will have ‘JS-Band-token’ as a key and ‘1234’ as a value in the local storage.

## Acceptance criteria:
